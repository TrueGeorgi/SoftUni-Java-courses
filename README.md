# SoftUni-Java-courses

In the various folders are some of the exercises I do during my courses at Software University.

The goals of uploading them here, is to have quick access. You can have a look at the concepts that i have used here, but for better look at my skills and the concepts and constructs i like to use, please refer to some of the other repositories.
