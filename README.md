# SoftUni-Java-courses

In the various folders are some of the exercises I do during my courses at Software University.

The reason for uploading them here is to have quick access. You can have a look at the concepts that I have used here, but for a better understanding of my skills and the concepts and constructs which I like to use, please refer to some of my other repositories.
